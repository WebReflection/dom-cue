# About this module signals implementation

This document goal is to describe what *signals* are and how these work within this module,
considering this is just one out of dozen different variants where performance or features
might be better or reacher, yet the goal here was to really provide a "*good enough*"
architecture that scales well, performs well and, most importantly, fits in less than 600 bytes
once minified and compressed.

Please remember that this API is fully based on [Preact Signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/) one, so that more documentation around this topic can be find out there.

## What is a Signal ?

Imagine a *red üü• / green üü©* traffic light üö¶ as a metaphore to describe what signals are and how these work:

  * if you don't pass through that road, you have no interest about their state
  * if you do pass through that road, you drive accordingly to their state:
    * *red* üü• means stop the car and wait for a state change
    * *green* üü© means keep going or start the engine again and move on
  * if you never need to pass through that road again, you can forget about that traffic light

If this metaphore is not good enough, let's try with some concrete example:

```python
tl = signal("üü•")

@computed
def journey():
    # while executing, we subscribe to `tl`
    # signal by accessing its current value
    if tl.value == "üü•":
        return "waiting"
    else:
        return "driving"

# let's "compute" the curent journey value
print(journey.value) # "waiting"

# ... time passes ...
import time
time.sleep(1)

# the signal value changes
tl.value = "üü©"

# if we access again the journey.value
# it will be executed, hence updated
print(journey.value) # "driving"
```

In this basic example there are a few things to observe that are part of the deal:

  * the `journey` function is executed only when its `value` field is accessed, **but**:
    * if the signal hasn't changed state, `journey.value` will return its latest computed result and **it will not execute again**
    * if the signal state changed between one `journey.value` access and another, it's comupted result will be updated and it will never execute again (or at least, not until `tl.value` changes again)
  * we can access `journey.value` dozen times without worrying it's going to invoke over and over its logic, that's the "*magic*" of *computed* signals, they make code automatically efficient without much thinking!

On the other hand, in the previous basic example it's our code explicitly accessing `journey.value` to retrieve it's latest state, which is very different from how *Event* driven logic works: the `journey` logic won't ever run again unless we access its `value`!

## What is an Effect ?

An *effect* is, behind the scene, a special *computed* reference that automatically executes whenever a *signal* changes its state, as opposite of requiring manual access to its `.value`.

Keeping the example simple, let's see how *effect* changes the previous code and behaves more like an *Event* listener:

```python
tl = signal("üü•")

@effect
def journey():
    # while executing, we subscribe to `tl`
    # signal by accessing its current value
    if tl.value == "üü•":
        print("waiting")
    else:
        print("driving")

# effects are instantly resolved/computed
# "waiting"

# ... time passes ...
import time
time.sleep(1)

# the signal value changes
tl.value = "üü©"

# effect will run again without hints
# "driving"
```

The *beauty* or *power* of *effects*, compared to an *event listeners* based approach, is that one can automatically subscribe to multiple *signals* or even multiple *computed* references, which is something otherwise convoluted to orchestrate in JS via listeners:

```js
// meta-example code
function reactiveCallback({ target, type }) {
  switch (type) {
    case 'changed': {
      // do something related to changes
      break;
    }
    case 'updated': {
      // do something related to updates
      break;
    }
    case 'erased': {
      // do something related to erase
      break;
    }
  }

  // there is no way to also operate both change
  // and updated or erased at the same time
  // events are always unique and never grouped

  // let's imagine we want to remove all listeners
  if (condition) {
    el.removeEventListener('changed', reactiveCallback);
    el.removeEventListener('updated', reactiveCallback);
    el.removeEventListener('erased', reactiveCallback);
  }
}

el.addEventListener('changed', reactiveCallback);
el.addEventListener('updated', reactiveCallback);
el.addEventListener('erased', reactiveCallback);
```

In comparison, using *signals* would be slightly more natural:

```python
# actual example that works as expected

changed = signal(False)
updated = signal(False)
erased = signal(False)

@effect
def reactive_callback():
    print("computing")
    # a "batched" change could've updated all
    # signals subscribed in this effect, example:
    if changed.value:
        print("changed")

    if updated.value:
        print("updated")

    if erased.value:
        print("erased")

    # cleanup this effect if all signals are True
    if changed.value and updated.value and erased.value:
        reactive_callback()

# first implicit *run*
# "coputing"

# change many signals at once
@batch
def change_all():
    changed.value = not changed.value
    updated.value = not updated.value

# now the effect will run *once* with 2 changes

# "computing"
# "changed"
# "updated"

# update the last signal to cleanup the *effect*
erased.value = not erased.value

# "computing"
# "changed"
# "updated"
# "erased"

# because these are all `True` and the *effect* is gone,
# changes to these signals will not trigger the effect
changed.value = not changed.value
updated.value = not updated.value
erased.value = not erased.value

# ... crickets ... nothing logged, goodbye effect üëã
```

With this counter example we have learned at least a couple of things:

  * an *effect* can subscribe to multiple *signals* or *computed* references
  * an effect can be "*destroyed*" by invoking itself, as that's something one should never do manually except to cleanup the *effect* because the whole point of *effects* is that these are automatically handled by the signals *implementation*

Last, but not least, while cleaning an *effect* is usually more rare than useful, it is also possible to return a callback that will run before the *effect* will be invoked again:

```python
count = signal(0)

@effect
def counter():
    print(f"count is now {counte.value}")

    return lambda: print("it's now different")

# "count is now 0"

count.value += 1
# "it's now different"
# "count is now 1"

count.value += 1
# "it's now different"
# "count is now 2"
```

The "*cleanup*" optionally returned function hence provides a way to *abort* some network request, stop intervals created within the effect, invalidate some previous state or even just log the fact the effect is being "*destroyed*" or it's going to be updated.

### Nested Effects

Each *effect* is confined within its logic but it's possible to have multiple effects with an outer "*main effect*":

```python
counter = signal(0)
multiplier = signal(1)
op = computed(lambda: counter.value * multiplier.value)

@effect
def main():
    print(f"the counter is now {counter.value}")

    @effect
    def multiplied():
        # `.peek()` to retrieve a value without subscribing
        m = multiplier.peek()
        # `multiplier` is subscribed by `op` implicitly
        print(f"  ‚Ä¢ multiplied by {m} is {op.value}")

# the counter is now 0
#   ‚Ä¢ multiplied by 1 is 0

print("------------------------")

# both the main effect and the nested one depend
# on the counter value, directly or indirectly
counter.value = 2

# the counter is now 2
#   ‚Ä¢ multiplied by 1 is 0 # ‚ùî previous compute
#   ‚Ä¢ multiplied by 1 is 2 # ‚úîÔ∏è updated compute

print("------------------------")

# only the nested effect depends on the multiplier value
# so only the nested effect will run here
multiplier.value = 2

#   ‚Ä¢ multiplied by 2 is 4
```

In this nested effect examples we've learned even more things:

  * there is the possibility to have nested *effects* where the outer one will take care of orchestrating updates
  * there is a `signal.peek()` or `computed.peek()` utility to read some value without subscribing to it
  * some nested effect might run with previous value but the important thing is that their last run will update their computed value once and that will remain stable until something changes
  * computed can be used anywhere signals can be used

### The last one: untracked(callback)

Specially for debugging reasons, we might want to access signals or computed values without interfering with the rest of the logic or accidentally subscribing to signals we don't want to observe.

The `untracked` utility returns any value and it will never bother subscription:

```python
s = signal(1)

@untracked
def current_value():
    return s.value

print(current_value)
# 1
```

And that's it for this module API, the only thing left to discuss is *how* actually things are implemented in here, which is a deep dive into technical details.
